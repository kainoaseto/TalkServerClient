# TalkServerClient

C WIN32 BSD socket based server and client that allows for simple communication online. 
Some features:
- Buffer management to allow for the CMD line to be updated in place
- Moduler codebase to allow for "include" files to be used elsewhere
- Decent reference for Win32 socket APIs
